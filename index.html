        This fudgy, old-fashioned chocolate pudding cake is baked with two delicious layers: a chocolate cake and a
        gooey pudding-like sauce. If you love the flavor and texture of a good old chocolate pudding, then you’re going
        to love this cake!
    </p>
    <p>I’ve been invited to a few birthdays lately, which means I had quite a few cakes to make. I took one of my mom’s
        old recipe notebooks and leafed through the pages to try and find some of our family’s all-time favorite sweets.
        Almost every recipe consisted of notes added over the years, each in a different pen color. I then came across
        this pudding cake that I loved as a kid. There were no notes for this recipe, and I like to believe that’s
        because it’s perfect.

    <p>Pudding cakes offer two treats in one and consist of two layers – a comforting, gooey chocolate cake and a thick
        chocolaty sauce that tastes just like an old-fashioned chocolate pudding. This cake goes by many names:
        chocolate upside down cake, hot fudge pudding cake, brownie pudding cake, or self-saucing pudding cake.
    </p>

        The process of making chocolate pudding cake is a bit different than other desserts, but I promise you’ll have
        amazing results.

        The first layer is the cake batter and the second layer consists of a “dry” mixture of cocoa and sugar. We then
        pour hot water evenly on top and while baking (I know, it feels so wrong, but it’s what makes this cake so
        good), the water sinks to the bottom and creates a chocolate sauce. The cake then rises to the top creating this
        deliciously warm and gooey chocolate pudding cake.
